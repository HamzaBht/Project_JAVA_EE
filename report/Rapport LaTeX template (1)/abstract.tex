This document is the report of our work on the JEE Project, whose objective is the development of a  \textbf{Flight Comparator}.
\\ \par
The main objectif of this project is to enable the comparison of airline flight offers, to present users with the best flight deals and opportunities they seek according to their needs and schedule and financial conditions.
\\ \par
In order to achieve this, we went through several phases : a first phase of study of the theoretical context and technical aspects of the subject, a second phase of design in which we were able to test the different approaches to solving the problem, then a third phase of project finalisation and presentation of results. We will therefore present throughout this report, the steps we followed as well as the tools we used to carry out this project.
